## Tell us about a project you led. What was your biggest mistake & what did you learn from it?
In school, I and some of my friends noticed a lot of paper being wasted during a origami competition. So, I led my friends to collect all those waste paper and sent them for recycling. On that single day, we collected about 5 kgs of paper from all around our school. Inspired by this, we continued to collect paper all through the year. And we also started collecting stationaries that students would forget and leave which would have got thrown out, we then gave these items to students who didn't have one. This went all successful for about a year.

The biggest mistake that I did was that we didn't pass on this practice to the next batch. After our batch graduated, the juniors did not take this up and we did not pass it down to them. This resulted in the fact that, whatever positive we were able to bring to our community was soon forgotten and not continued.  

The most important thing that I learned from this little experiment of ours was that, we should  encourage the next set of people to continue and assimilate the experiences, service, and the knowledge that we acquired. Or else everything we worked hard for, will burn to ashes and it would become pointless. 

## What are you building now & why does it matter?

I am currently building a ChipSat. These satellites are absolutely tiny compared to traditional satellites.  These satellites will be used in light sail missions to alien planets outside the solar system. Due to their low mass and compactness, these systems would be probably be the first manmade object to explore these new horizons. 

The ChipSats I’m building would be smaller than any other mission has ever attempted to be.  They would transmit radio signals from orbit independently of a larger craft. This would be a technology demonstration mission to prove the feasibility of such small spacecrafts designed with cost and efficiency in mind. 

This is a passion project of mine that I have been working on for the last 2 years, going through many iterations and designs. Now I have finished designing the electronic and physical design of the satellite. What’s left is to build the prototype in real life and test it through weather ballon missions. I’m currently in talks with ISRO regarding launching a implementation of this on one of their upcoming missions. I have also coordinated and partnered with a US based student organisation for the test weather balloon mission, once the prototype is ready.
